### Ahoy! 👋

I'm Jonny - working for Sero as a Lead Software Engineer 🌍

Currently dabbling in game development with Godot! Stay tuned for some excited news on this! 🎮

I’m an avid cyclist, recovering rower, and I have a penchant for pizza. I’ve also lost more hours to Baldur’s Gate 3 than I would care to admit here. 🍕
