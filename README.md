### Ahoy! 👋

I'm Jonny - a Software Engineer and aspiring Game Developer 🌍

Currently dabbling in game development with Godot! Check out Parley, the easy-to-use, writer-first, scalable dialogue management system: https://parley.bisterixstudio.com/

I’m an avid cyclist, recovering rower, and I have a penchant for pizza. I’ve also lost more hours to Baldur’s Gate 3 than I would care to admit here. 🍕
